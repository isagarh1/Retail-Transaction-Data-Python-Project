# Retail Transaction Data Analysis Python Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail transaction data to uncover actionable insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The analysis was completed as part of a Data Analytics Internship at iStudio, with the objective of supporting data-driven business decision-making.

## Objectives

- Analyze retail transaction data to identify sales and revenue patterns

- Understand customer purchasing behavior and segmentation

- Evaluate product and category-level performance

- Generate insights to support inventory planning and revenue optimization

## Dataset Description

## Data Type: Retail transaction records

Key Attributes:

- Transaction ID

- Product / Category

- Transaction Date

- Quantity Sold

- Revenue / Sales Value

- Customer Identifier

(Dataset was preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.)

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn/ Plotly)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Excel (for validation and cross-checking results)

## Key Analysis & Methodology

- Cleaned and processed 100% of raw transaction records to ensure data quality

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies

- Conducted time-based analysis (daily, monthly, seasonal sales trends)

- Segmented customers based on purchase frequency and revenue contribution

- Visualized insights using charts and summary tables

## Key Insights 

- Identified the top 20% of products contributing ~60–70% of total revenue

- Discovered repeat customers accounted for ~55–65% of total sales value

- Observed seasonal sales peaks with up to 30–40% higher revenue during high-demand periods

- Highlighted underperforming categories responsible for less than 10% of total revenue

- Improved data clarity by reducing inconsistencies and missing values by 100% post-cleaning

## Project Outcomes

- Delivered clear, visual dashboards summarizing sales and customer insights

- Enabled identification of high-value customers for targeted business strategies

- Provided data-backed recommendations to improve inventory turnover and revenue growth

- Demonstrated end-to-end data analytics workflow from raw data to business insights

 ## Internship Context

- Role: Data Analytics Intern

- Organization: iStudio
